### Overview
I began my career as a designer/UX engineer and gradually transitioned into frontend engineering.

Below are just a small sample of animations that I could find from notable projects/ positions throughout my career.

### Projects

#### Modern web (React, Leaflet, D3 + SVG)
- HYPR3: Built a social content aggregation map for Marriott (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) that periodically surfaced posts as map popups across properties; the project earned major awards (Gold and Silver Cannes Lions) and became HYP3R’s flagship product. It was later repurposed for LA Fitness, and Norwegian Cruise Lines. Built with Leaflet, D3.js, and SVG: [hyp3r3.mp4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/hyp3r3.mp4)

#### CSS animations (@keyframes)
- Card flip animation for a one-off client. This was created using pure CSS @keyframes: [Cardflip.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/Cardflip.mov)
- Simple hover effect for the same client. [SampleButtonHover.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/SampleButtonHover.mov)

#### 3D visualization (Three.js)
- Medida Metrics: Designed and built a custom diagramming interface in Three.js for healthcare administrators to model complex workflows—predating tools like Figma, Zeplin, and Miro: [medidaMetrics.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/medidaMetrics.mov)

#### Legacy interactive (Flash / ActionScript / E4X)
- Along with supervising a team of designers and frontend engineers, I focused on crafting subtle, high‑impact animations. For the company's bicentennial celebration, I built an interactive multimedia gallery showcasing images, videos, and audio submitted by current and former employees; it was repurposed across UPS, including on their NASCAR site. I also created hundreds of animated ads that ran across major websites, consistently driving high click‑through rates. The examples are just a small sample.

  - “Ad as a game” to sort packages: [ups2.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/ups2.mov)


Beyond these samples, I’ve designed and built everything from sprites, loading animations, and hover effects to complex animated interfaces for a range of companies.
