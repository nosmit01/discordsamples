### Overview
Selected interactive work samples. Each item links to a short video.

### Projects

#### Modern web (React, Leaflet, D3 + SVG)
- Award‑winning React geo app for Marriott (Gold and Silver Cannes Lions). This was later repurposed for LA Fitness, and Norwegian Cruise Lines. Built with Leaflet, D3.js, and SVG. Video: [hyp3r3.mp4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/hyp3r3.mp4)

#### 3D visualization (Three.js)
- Interactive diagramming built entirely in Three.js. Video: [medidaMetrics.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/medidaMetrics.mov)

#### Legacy interactive (Flash / ActionScript / E4X)
- UPS historical timeline gallery: [ups1.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/ups1.mov)
- “Ad as a game” to sort packages: [ups2.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/ups2.mov)

Beyond these samples, I’ve designed and built everything from sprites, loading animations, and hover effects to complex animated interfaces for a range of companies.
