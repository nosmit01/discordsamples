### Overview
Selected interactive work samples. Each item links to a short video.

### Projects

#### Modern web (React, Leaflet, D3 + SVG)
- Award‑winning React geo app for Marriott (Gold and Silver Cannes Lions). This was later repurposed for LA Fitness, and Norwegian Cruise Lines. Built with Leaflet, D3.js, and SVG. Video: [hyp3r3.mp4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/hyp3r3.mp4)

#### CSS animations (@keyframes)
- Card flip animation for a one-off client. This was created using pure CSS @keyframes: [Cardflip.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/Cardflip.mov)
- Simple hover effect for the same client. [SampleButtonHover.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/SampleButtonHover.mov)

#### 3D visualization (Three.js)
- Interactive diagramming built entirely in Three.js. Video: [medidaMetrics.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/medidaMetrics.mov)

#### Legacy interactive (Flash / ActionScript / E4X)
- UPS historical timeline gallery: [ups1.mov](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosmit01/discordsamples/main/ups1.mov)

### Other things to note:
I began my career as a designer/UX engineer and gradually transitioned into frontend engineering.

Here are more details about notable projects/ positions from the start of my career to the most recent:

- Ad Engine: Franchise-focused ad agency where I produced animated Flash ads.

- UPS: Along with supervising a team of designers and frontend engineers, I focused on crafting subtle, high‑impact animations. For the company's bicentennial celebration, I built an interactive multimedia gallery showcasing images, videos, and audio submitted by current and former employees; it was repurposed across UPS, including on their NASCAR site.

I also created hundreds of animated ads that ran across major websites, consistently driving high click‑through rates. The examples above are a small sample.

- AT&T: Post‑merger, I refreshed the online help center’s branding and UI, adding intuitive, subtle animated hover effects and page transitions.

- Medida Metrics: Designed and built a custom diagramming interface for healthcare administrators to model complex workflows—predating tools like Figma, Zeplin, and Miro.

- HYP3R: Built a social content aggregation map for Marriott (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) that periodically surfaced posts as map popups across properties; the project earned major awards and became HYP3R’s flagship product.


Beyond these samples, I’ve designed and built everything from sprites, loading animations, and hover effects to complex animated interfaces for a range of companies.
